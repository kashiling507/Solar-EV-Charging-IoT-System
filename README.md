## 🔧 Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SolarEV-IoT.git
cd SolarEV

2️⃣ Setup the Database
Import database.sql into MySQL
Update db.php with your database credentials
3️⃣ Upload Code to ESP32
Configure WiFi and API endpoints in the ESP32 code
4️⃣ Run the Web Application
bash
Copy
Edit
php -S localhost:8000
🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ User logs into the system and books a charging slot
2️⃣ The system checks solar energy availability before approval
3️⃣ If conditions are met, charging starts automatically
4️⃣ Users can monitor charging status in real-time
5️⃣ Payment & usage history available in the dashboard
